Final Project for Writing Machines (Fall 2016)

*Purpose of Code* 

*Analyze* 

This function, called compare_pronouns, uses regex to find and calculate the percentage of first person singular, first person plural, and third person plural pronouns in two different texts. While the function was developed with the ultimate goal of comparing speeches by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, it will accept any two .txt files as an argument, allowing the user to compare any two pieces of writing that they find interesting. Users must find and save .txt files, then upload those files to python notebook.
